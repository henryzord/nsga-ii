# Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II

Implementation of Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II.

Displays Pareto Fronts using matplotlib. All individuals in one front 
dominate (i.e. are better in all criteria) individuals in other fronts (e.g.
front 1 dominates front 2); but within the same front, individuals are
equivalent, regarding multiple criteria.
